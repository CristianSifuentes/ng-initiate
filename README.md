# Angular Project Structure Explained

This guide breaks down the key files and folders in a typical Angular project (as seen in the provided screenshot). Understanding each part helps you become more efficient and make informed decisions when building and maintaining Angular applications.

## üìÅ Folders Overview

### `.vscode/`
- **Purpose**: Stores VS Code-specific settings such as debugging configurations or code format rules.
- **Important?**: Only affects your local development environment.

### `node_modules/`
- **Purpose**: Contains all installed npm packages.
- **Important?**: üö® **Yes**, but never edit directly. It's managed by npm.

### `public/`
- **Purpose**: Optional. Can be used for static assets (images, manifest, favicon, etc.).
- **Important?**: Used mostly in custom configurations.

### `src/`
- **Purpose**: üß† **Core folder** of your Angular app. Contains all TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and component logic.
- **Important?**: ‚úÖ **Absolutely**. This is where your app is built.

## üìÑ Root Files

### `.editorconfig`
- **Purpose**: Maintains consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
- **Important?**: Helpful for teams, optional for solo devs.

### `.gitignore`
- **Purpose**: Specifies which files and folders Git should ignore.
- **Highlights**: Includes `node_modules`, `dist`, `*.log`, etc.
- **Important?**: ‚úÖ Yes, keeps your repo clean.

### `angular.json`
- **Purpose**: üîß Configuration for Angular CLI.
- **Highlights**:
  - Build options
  - File replacements
  - Asset paths
  - Architect targets (build/test/lint)
- **Important?**: ‚úÖ Yes. Controls your build and dev behavior.

### `LICENSE`
- **Purpose**: States the license under which your code is published.
- **Important?**: Important if open-source or working in enterprises.

### `package.json`
- **Purpose**: üì¶ Manages npm packages, scripts, and metadata.
- **Highlights**:
  - `scripts` (e.g., `ng build`, `ng serve`, `ng test`)
  - `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
- **Important?**: ‚úÖ **Crucial** for project execution and dependency management.

### `package-lock.json`
- **Purpose**: Locks the versions of installed packages to ensure consistent installs.
- **Important?**: Yes. Keeps everyone‚Äôs environment consistent.

### `README.md`
- **Purpose**: Project description and usage instructions.
- **Important?**: ‚úÖ Important for documentation and onboarding.

### `tsconfig.app.json`
- **Purpose**: TypeScript config specific to the application.
- **Highlights**:
  - Includes paths and compilation rules for app files.
- **Important?**: Yes. Affects how the app is compiled.

### `tsconfig.json`
- **Purpose**: Global TypeScript configuration.
- **Highlights**:
  - Base settings for all `tsconfig.*.json` files.
- **Important?**: ‚úÖ Yes. Defines type safety and compiler behavior.

### `tsconfig.spec.json`
- **Purpose**: TypeScript config for testing.
- **Important?**: Yes, if you're writing unit tests.

## üèÜ Most Important Elements
| Item               | Reason                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/`             | üí° All app logic and structure lives here                              |
| `angular.json`     | üîß Controls how Angular CLI builds and serves your app                 |
| `package.json`     | üì¶ Manages dependencies and scripts                                    |
| `tsconfig.json`    | ‚öôÔ∏è Base TypeScript settings for the entire project                     |
| `.gitignore`       | üßº Keeps your repository clean and free of generated clutter           |

## ‚úÖ Final Notes
- Most of your development will happen inside `src/`.
- Angular CLI uses `angular.json`, `tsconfig.*.json`, and `package.json` to configure builds and manage dependencies.
- Keep your `.gitignore` clean to avoid bloating your repo.

# Basic

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
