# üß† Building Reactive UIs with Angular Signals: A Practical Profile Editor

## ‚ú® Tell Your Story
In modern Angular development, developers seek better reactivity without excessive boilerplate or dependency on complex state management tools. Angular 16+ introduced **Signals**‚Äîa new reactivity model that enables a more declarative and efficient approach to state tracking in your components.

In this article, we will explore how to use Angular Signals with strings and objects through a real-world example: a **reactive user profile editor**. We'll demonstrate best practices using `signal()`, `computed()`, `effect()`, and `mutate()` to efficiently manage user data and respond to changes in a declarative style.

## ü§î What Are Signals?
Signals are **reactive primitives** introduced in Angular 16 that allow you to manage reactive state with fine-grained control. Unlike RxJS Observables, signals:
- Do not require subscription management.
- Trigger updates automatically in views.
- Are optimized for performance.

Three core APIs include:
- `signal()`: defines a reactive writable value.
- `computed()`: creates derived signals based on one or more others.
- `effect()`: executes side effects when signals change.

---

## üí¨ Use Signals with Strings and Objects
In our example, we‚Äôll demonstrate signals using:
- Primitive string types (`firstName`, `lastName`).
- An object type `UserProfile`, which we will mutate reactively.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Update and Display User Data
We'll build a user profile editor that dynamically updates the display as you type. It will react to:
- Changes in the name fields.
- Email updates.

---

## üîÅ React to Specific Changes with `effect()`
We'll use `effect()` to monitor signal changes and log a warning when a user sets their email to a known placeholder domain (e.g., `@example.com`). This technique is also useful for form validation, logging, analytics, or triggering external updates.

## üß† Use `computed()` to Derive a Full Name
Rather than manually combining fields every time, we use `computed()` to derive the full name reactively. This ensures data consistency without duplication of logic.

---

## üß¨ Show How to `mutate()` Objects Safely
Instead of replacing an entire object, `mutate()` allows updating nested properties in a controlled and efficient way. This avoids unnecessary object references and re-renders.

---

## üí° Advanced Example: `user-profile.component.ts`
```ts
import { Component, signal, computed, effect } from '@angular/core';

interface UserProfile {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-profile',
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <div class="profile-card">
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <label>First Name: <input [(ngModel)]="firstName()" (ngModelChange)="updateFirstName($event)" /></label>
      <label>Last Name: <input [(ngModel)]="lastName()" (ngModelChange)="updateLastName($event)" /></label>
      <label>Email: <input [(ngModel)]="user().email" (ngModelChange)="updateEmail($event)" /></label>
      <hr />
      <p>Full Name: {{ fullName() }}</p>
      <p>Email: {{ user().email }}</p>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [
    `.profile-card {
      background: #f5f5f5;
      padding: 1rem;
      border-radius: 8px;
      width: 320px;
    }`,
    `label { display: block; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; }`,
    `input { width: 100%; padding: 0.25rem; margin-top: 0.25rem; }`
  ]
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
  firstName = signal('Ada');
  lastName = signal('Lovelace');

  user = signal<UserProfile>({
    firstName: 'Ada',
    lastName: 'Lovelace',
    email: 'ada@angular.dev'
  });

  fullName = computed(() => `${this.firstName()} ${this.lastName()}`);

  constructor() {
    effect(() => {
      const currentEmail = this.user().email;
      if (currentEmail.endsWith('@example.com')) {
        console.warn(`Warning: Placeholder email detected: ${currentEmail}`);
      }
    });
  }

  updateFirstName(value: string) {
    this.firstName.set(value);
    this.user.mutate(user => user.firstName = value);
  }

  updateLastName(value: string) {
    this.lastName.set(value);
    this.user.mutate(user => user.lastName = value);
  }

  updateEmail(value: string) {
    this.user.mutate(user => user.email = value);
  }
}
```

## üîç Key Concepts in This Example
| Feature            | Purpose                                                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `signal()`         | Reactive primitive for both primitives and complex types           |
| `computed()`       | Derives values automatically when dependencies change              |
| `effect()`         | Executes logic based on reactive value changes                    |
| `mutate()`         | Updates part of an object without replacing the whole signal value |
| `ngModel + signals`| Demonstrates how signals integrate with Angular forms              |

## üß™ Bonus Challenge
For extended learning and refinement:
- Add a signal that tracks form validity (e.g., `isValidName`, `isValidEmail`).
- Create a `reset()` method to restore original values using `.set()`.
- Add a list of name changes using `signal<string[]>`.
- Create a toggle mode (`isEditMode`) with computed `readonly` fields.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Angular Signals offer a powerful and elegant solution for managing state reactively without the overhead of RxJS. With minimal code, you can:
- Track and display changes in real-time
- Create dynamic derived data
- React to changes declaratively with effects

This new paradigm simplifies how we manage component logic and enhances maintainability, especially in complex applications.

Angular's future is reactive ‚Äî and it's a great time to embrace Signals as your new go-to state primitive.
